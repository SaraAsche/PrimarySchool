# Analysis of primary school interaction dataset by Barrat et al. [^1]

The current github repository contains all methods, code and data used to analyse the primary school interaction dataset by Barrat et al. [^1] for Sara Johanne Asche's master thesis on modelling the spread of COVID-19
in Primary schools.

## Structure

All the data analysed and output from the model can be found in the data folder. Furthermore figures generated are placed in fig_master. Since linear regression was plotted for all single nodes, the generated images are placed in the separate folder R2_img.
